# NumQuad
MATLAB implementation of some well known numerical quadrature rules. 

The following quadrature rules have been implemented: 
- Composite-Trapezoidal method 
- Composite-Simpson method 
- Generalized Closed Newton-Cotes method 
- Gauss-Chebyshev method 
- Gauss-Hermite method 
- Gauss-Legendre method 
- Gauss-Laguerre method 
- Gauss-Lobatto method

The code is meant to be beginner friendly and aimed at those starting out with Numerical analysis. You can also find the associated theory if you feel the need of a refresher.
